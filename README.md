<h1>Halloween Candy Dispenser - 2021</h1>



 <h3>Summary</h3>
<p>

The new design functioned by the trick-or-treater pressing the button for the candy they wanted and the conveyor belt activated to dispense the candy to the ramp which would then fall in to the trick-or-treater's hand or bag. The button also updated the graph shown on the ipad. The LED lights did a chase pattern that was not tied to the buttons at all. It just cycled through the color spectrum in a loop. Also, as you may have already noticed, I ran out of white filament and replaced it with black for the nerds conveyor belt holder.
