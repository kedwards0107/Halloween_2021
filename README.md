<h1>Halloween Candy Dispenser - 2021</h1>



 <h3>Summary</h3>
<p>

 For the second iteration of the Halloween project we wanted to add dispensing which was definitely a challenge because each candy was a different size and shape. Additionally, I wanted to minimize the number of motors needed to dispense the candies. In the end, I decided to go with a rack and pinion design which only used two motors. Due to covid, we also decided to use motion sensors to activate the dispensing so that the trick-or-treaters wouldn't need to press a button, they would simply place their bag under the ramp to activate the dispensing. Well... that was the idea anyway.
